### Super-Resolution

The goal of this project is to perform Super-resolution on microscopic images of kidneys and tongues. Deep CNN models like Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) and Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR) networks were used.

Image pre-processing and post-processing was done in MATLAB and the model was built using Caffe.

The pre processing steps consist of:

(1) Image Registration

(2) Color Correction

Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio was used to evaluate the performance of these models. A PSNR of 0.05 dB was obtained using SRCNN and a PSNR of 0.33 dB was obtained using VDSR
