# Super-Resolution
This repo contains the code to perform Super-resolution on images using SRCNN and VDSR.

Image pre-processing and post-processing was done in MATLAB and training on Caffe.

The following folders contain the code for pre processing steps:

(1) Image Registration

(2) Color Correction


The following folders contain the code for the model and post processing steps:

(1) SRCNN (contains the model code in Caffe and PSNR calculation in MATLAB)

(2) VDSR (contains the model code in Caffe and PSNR calculation in MATLAB)
